here is a brief introduction of each branch:  
`Project number`: `content` (`base_stage`)  
**P0**: digital circuits (Logism)  
**P1**: digital circuits focus on state-machine (Verilog)  
**P2**: mips assembly language (Mars)  
**P3**: Single cycle CPU with 9 mips commands (Logism)  
**P4**: Single cycle CPU with 9 mips commands (Verilog)  
**P5**: Pipelined CPU with 11 mips commands (Verilog)  
**P6**: Pipelined CPU with 52 mips commands (Verilog)  
**P7**: Pipelined CPU with interrupt/exception handling supported (Verilog)
